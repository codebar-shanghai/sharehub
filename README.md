* [Exciting Repos](https://gist.github.com/IronBlood/3470d686224861be91f34205f1c51647) - `awesome-list` A list of interesting repositories that might be helpful. Made by Yang Shen in 2022, maybe some items are outdated.
* MIT 6.004 Computation Structures ([Intro](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-004-computation-structures-spring-2017/) | [Fall 2018](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDSlqjcPpoL64CJdF0Qee5oWqGS6we_Yu)) - `open-courseware` `video` This course introduces architecture of digital systems, emphasizing structural principles common to a wide range of technologies. It covers the topics including multilevel implementation strategies, definition of new primitives (e.g., gates, instructions, procedures, processes) and their mechanization using lower-level elements. It also includes analysis of potential concurrency, precedence constraints and performance measures, pipelined and multidimensional systems, instruction set design issues and architectural support for contemporary software structures.
* MIT 6.006 Introduction to Algorithms ([Intro](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-spring-2020/) | [Fall, 2011](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61Oq3tWYp6V_F-5jb5L2iHb) | [Spring, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP63EdVPNLG3ToM6LaEUuStEY)) - `algorithms` `open-courseware` `video` This course is an introduction to mathematical modeling of computational problems, as well as common algorithms, algorithmic paradigms, and data structures used to solve these problems. It emphasizes the relationship between algorithms and programming and introduces basic performance measures and analysis techniques for these problems.
